# Simple_FTP_Cracker
I wrote this simple script based on the code from on a shot class I took. I added a few things and tooks some unnecessary lines out.
I may comeback and add features
You'll need to supply a credential file and make sure you execute the script in the same dirrectory where the credential file is located.
Credentials should be formated as such:
